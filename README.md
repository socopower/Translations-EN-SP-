# Translations (EN/SP)

Hey anon, I made this repository with the purpose of having a place to show all the translations that I make, usually they will be translations to the documentation of a project within the crypto/web3/blockchain ecosystem and at the same time, this small repository will serve as a "portfolio " for future translations.

Usually, all the parts/chapters of the documentations that I translate, I publish on my [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@socopower) profile.

Below you can find a table that will contain:

- Project's name
- Number of words
- Start Date
- End Date
- Translation link
- Difficulty 
- Translation cost (if applicable)

| Project's name | Number of words | Start date | End date | Translation link | Difficulty | Translation cost |
|     :---:      |     :---:       |    :---:   |     :---:    |     :---:     |     :---:     |     :---:     |
